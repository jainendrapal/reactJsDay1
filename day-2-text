props


Props are used for passing data to child component as attribute

props are usually passed down from 'above' parent component

Props are immutable 


state

State is used for defining the shape of data both initially and upon user interaction

state is created in the component it gets its initial data in the constructor() method

State is changeable 
we can use setState to change the value

class Point {
    var x = 0;
    var y = 0;
    function constructor() {
    	log("defult");
    }
    function constructor(x : number, y : number) {
    	log("x y");
        	this.set(x, y);
    }
    function constructor(other : Point) {
    	log("other");
	this.set(other);
    }
   function set(x : number, y : number) : void {
	this.x = x;
	this.y = y;
    }
    function set(other : Point) : void {
	this.set(other.x, other.y);
    }
    function show():void{
    	log(this.x);
    	log(this.y);
    }
}


class _Main{
	static function main(args : string[]) : void {
			var p=new Point();
			p.set(10,20);
			p.show();
	}
}




JSX is faster because it performs optimization while compiling code to JavaScript.
It is also type-safe and most of the errors can be caught during compilation.
JSX makes it easier and faster to write templates if you are familiar with HTML.





JSX is a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript. You can definitely use React without JSX but JSX makes React a lot more elegant.
Just like XML, JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children. If an attribute value is enclosed in quotes, the value is a string. Otherwise, wrap the value in braces and the value is the enclosed JavaScript expression.
